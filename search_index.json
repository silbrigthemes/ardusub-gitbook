The information in this guide applies to ArduSub V3.5 and up. If you are running an older version, you should update.\n\nArduSub and the ArduPilot Project\nThe ArduSub project is a fully-featured open-source solution for remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). ArduSub is a part of the ArduPilot project, and was originally derived from the ArduCopter code. ArduSub has extensive capabilities out of the box including feedback stability control, depth and heading hold, and autonomous navigation.\nArduSub is designed to be safe, feature-rich, open-ended, and easy to use even for novice users.\nArduSub works seamlessly with Ground Control Station software that can monitor vehicle telemetry and perform powerful mission planning activities. It also benefits from other parts of the ArduPilot platform, including simulators, log analysis tools, and higher level APIs for vehicle management and control.\nArduSub is on the leading edge of marine robotics and intended for anyone who wants to operate a vehicle below the water's surface. There is support for many different ROV configurations, and adding a custom design is simple.\nAbout this Book\nThis book is an on-going work in progress to document the ArduSub software as well as supporting software and hardware. The documentation in this book is based on the most recent software available at the time of writing. In some cases, features or options documented here may be only available in developmental versions of the software. The authoring of this book and the ArduSub project are sponsored by Blue Robotics.\nLicense\n\nThe ArduSub and ArduPilot code are released under the GPLv3 License.\nThis book is released under the CC-NC-SA 4.0 License.\n\n"},"introduction/features.html":{"url":"introduction/features.html","title":"Features","keywords":"","body":"Features\nArduSub has many features including:\n\nBuilt-in support for several vehicle frame options and motor configurations (custom configurations are possible too)\nHigh extensibility in software and hardware for customization\nAttitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) and Inertial Navigation Filter (EKF)\nExtensive user-configurable parameter system\nWell developed ground control station software for piloting and configuration\nCompatibility with many development tools targeting MAVLink-enabled vehicles\nSensor and data logging\nNo Programming Required\n\nSupported Frames\nArduSub includes a high-level motor library that can configure motors in any configuration.

Sorry, your RC radio and WiFi connection will not penetrate water. In some cases, additional electronics are required at the ends of the tether to achieve reliable communications.\n\nTopside Components\nComputer\nThe following operating systems are supported use with the topside software (QGroundControl):\n\nWindows 10\nmacOS 10.10 or later\nUbuntu 16.04 or later\n\nJoystick\nThe following joysticks are supported for use with the topside software (QGroundControl):\n\nLogitech F310\nLogitech F710\nMicrosoft Xbox controllers\nWired PlayStation 4 controllers\n\nROV Components\nBelow is a typical diagram of hardware components on the ROV and their connections. Please note that many of the components on this diagram are optional, and this is not the only possible hardware configuration.\n\nAutopilot\nThe autopilot is responsible for controlling the ROV. The autopilot will typically have multiple on-board sensors like gyroscopes, accelerometers, and a compass to determine the vehicle's attitude. The autopilot processes the pilot input and sensor data, and controls the motors, lights, servos, and relays on the vehicle.\nDepth Sensor\nArduSub supports the use of the MS5837 (used in the Bar30) as an external water pressure and depth sensor. A depth sensor will need to be connected to the autopilot in order to use Depth Hold mode.\nLeak Sensor\nArduSub can be configured to read leak sensors, and perform a failsafe action when a leak is detected. The SOS leak sensor is an excellent option.\nBattery\nIt is recommended to design your vehicle to operate on battery power. Powering an ROV through the tether is not a trivial task, and is outside the scope of this documentation. Battery selection can be intimidating due to the overwhelming number of options, but there are only a few important considerations:\n\nVoltage: Batteries often specify their voltage as well as a corresponding 'S' rating indicating the number of 3.7V cells in wired in Series inside the battery. The voltage of your battery needs to be matched to the ratings of your ESCs. The Blue Robotics ESCs support 3S (11.1V) and 4S (14.8V) batteries. \nCapacity Batteries usually specify their capacity in units of mAh, the larger this number, the more energy the battery will store, and the longer you can run your ROV.\nCurrent Rating: Batteries usually specify a C rating for Current. In order to calculate the rated current in Amps, multiply the capacity of the battery in Ah (mAh/1000) times the C rating. For example, a 10000 mAh (10 Ah) battery with a 10C rating is rated for 100 Amps. As a general rule of thumb, your battery should be rated for a continuous current draw of 15 Amps times the number of thrusters.\n\nThis battery is a good bet for most cases, and it will fit inside a 3\" diameter enclosure.\nCompanion Computer\nThe Companion Computer has two major functions on the ROV:\n\nStreaming HD video to the surface computer\nRelaying communications between the autopilot and the Surface Computer via Ethernet communications\n\nThe companion computer must be running the Companion Computer Software to function correctly with ArduSub. Currently, only the Raspberry Pi 3 model B (not yet B+) is supported for use with the Companion Computer Software.\nCamera\nThe Companion Computer will stream HD video to the Ground Control Station at the surface. The Raspberry Pi camera and USB webcams with H.264 output are supported. The following USB webcams have been tested to work with the Companion Computer software:\n\nBlue Robotics H.264 USB Camera\n\nMotors and ESCs\nArduSub is designed to work with brushless motors. Brushless motors require Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) to operate. ArduSub requires all of the motors to operate in forward and reverse, so the ESC must support this functionality. Most ESCs for UAVs and Drones only operate in one direction! The following ESCs are supported for use with ArduSub:\n\nBlue Robotics Basic ESC\n\n\nSponsored by Blue Robotics.

Please see the details here depending on which tether interface is being used.\nSet Up Static IP\nIn an Ethernet-based setup, the Raspberry Pi defaults to the IP address of 192.168.2.2. The host computer must be set up with an IP address of 192.168.2.1 at the same network interface in order to communicate. See instructions in the Network Setup Guide.\nConnect QGC to Autopilot\nThe autopilot can be connected to QGC through several different methods depending on the hardware used.\nSerial Port Connection\nIf using a serial port, simply connect the port to the computer and open QGC. The controller should automatically connect to QGC and onboard data will be downloaded.\nEthernet Connection with Companion Computer\nIf an Ethernet connection is used, then a companion computer must be used to relay communications between the Pixhawk autopilot and the surface computer. The Pixhawk is connected to the companion computer via USB.\nEthernet Connection with Linux Autopilot (Navio, BBBmini, etc.)\nFor Linux based autopilots, the network connection is launched when the ArduSub code is started. For examples, please see the documentation for your respective autopilot.\nFrame Configuration\nThe vehicle frame is selected in the Frame tab of the Vehicle Setup page. Choose your desired frame, then reboot the autopilot.\nIf you have compiled ArduSub with a custom frame configuration, you may select your custom frame by setting the FRAME_CONFIG parameter to Custom.\nSensor Calibration\nAutopilots contain sensors that determine the vehicle's orientation and movement in 3-d space. These sensors include an accelerometer to sense acceleration and forces like gravity, a gyroscope to sense rotational movements, and a digital compass. ArduSub firmware can be operated normally without doing any sensor calibration. The sensors may be calibrated to provide more accurate data and improve performance. If you would like to calibrate the sensors in the autopilot, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the settings tab in QGC and select the Sensors tab on the left sidebar.\nChoose your autopilot orientation:\nNone for level orientation (such as the BlueROV1)\nRoll90 for the BlueROV2\n\n\nClick on Accelerometers and follow the instructions.\nClick on Compass and follow the instructions.\n\n\nNote The main symptom that you may need compass calibration is a bad heading indication, such as showing north in compass while pointing west. See also the troubleshooting section on compass drift\nWarning For using GPS-enabled modes, you must do the compass calibration.\n\nJoystick/Gamepad Calibration\nSome joysticks require calibration before they can be used with QGroundControl. This allows QGC to detect which axis is which and what the range of each axis is.\n\nClick \"Calibrate\" on the joystick page, then click \"Next\".\nFollow the instructions printed on the screen, and the diagram showing how to move the sticks for each step of the calibration.\nMake sure that the \"Enable joystick input\" checkbox is checked.\n\nButton Setup\nArduSub provides the capability to map different joystick buttons to different functions. The default button configuration is shown in the image below:\n\nEach button can be assigned to one primary function and one alternate \"shift\" function. If the \"shift\" functions are used, then a \"shift\" button must be assigned. This works like the shift key on your keyboard, altering the functionality of other buttons while pressed.\nYou can customize the button functions in the Joystick tab of the Vehicle Setup page. Pressing each button will light up the button number and then the desired function can be chosen. See the image below for an example setup:\n\nNote, if using a Logitech gamepad, pressing the \"mode\" button causes the left joystick and the button pad to switch places. Make sure the light next to \"mode\" is not illuminated. Also note that to use an Xbox controller or Logitech gamepad in \"X-input\" mode, you must install an X-input driver. We recommend 360Controller.\nSetup Voltage and Current Measurement\nOn the Power tab choose the appropriate setup. If using the standard 3DR Power Module, choose Analog Voltage and Current, the appropriate battery capacity, and the Power Module 90A. The battery capacity depends on the battery that you are using on your ROV and should be entered in mAh.\n\nSetup Low Voltage Failsafe\nOn the Safety tab set the battery failsafe to Warning and the desired voltage or capacity to trigger the alarm. Remember you will need some power to go back home.\n\n\nWarning Lithium Batteries should not be overdischarged, as it damages their internal chemistry. Do not let each cell's voltage get lower than 3.0 V.\n\nCamera Tilt Setup (if used)\nSelect the Camera tab. The \"Gimbal Tilt\" settings are used for the camera tilt. Choose whichever channel the servo is plugged into for \"Output channel\" and RC8 for \"Input channel\". Valid output channels are any of the unused motor outputs (RC1-RC8), and Aux outputs 1-4 (RC9-RC12). Select Servo for the \"Type\" under \"Gimbal Settings\" on the right.\n\nIs desired, you can check the Stabilize box, which will enable auto-stabilization of the camera based on the vehicle pitch angle. We generally leave this unchecked.\nLights Setup\nThe output channel for the lights is configured in the Lights tab of the Vehicle Setup page. Select the output channel that you have plugged your lights into, as shown below.\n\nInfo This setup only works with lights that are controllable with a servo PWM pulse, such as the Blue Robotics Lumen Lights.\n\n\nConfiguring Motor Directions\nAutomatic Motor Direction Setup\nAs of ArduSub 4.0, it is possible to automatically detect the thrusters directions and reverse them if necessary.\nTo do so, put the ROV in the water away from obstacles, and click \"Auto-Detect Directions\".\nThe ROV will briefly pulse each thruster and check if the IMU output matches the desired vector orientation, if they don't, the corresponding thruster setting will be reversed automatically.\nAdditional output from the process will be shown by the button, and when done the ROV will be disarmed and put back into Manual mode.\n\nManual Motor Direction Setup\nDue to clockwise and counterclockwise propellers, as well as wiring, the motor directions will have to be tested and corrected during initial setup. ArduSub includes a set of parameters for this purpose. The parameters are called MOT_n_DIRECTION where n is the output number, and valid values are normal or reverse.\nWe generally follow this process to check motor rotation directions:\n\nSet the flight mode to \"Manual\"\nArm vehicle\nMove the \"forward\" joystick forward and verify that the thrusters that produce some forward thrust are operating in the correct direction and blowing out the back of the vehicle\nMove the \"vertical\" joystick upwards and verify that the thrusters that produce some vertical thrust are operating in the correct direction and blowing air downwards\n\n\n\nSponsored by Blue Robotics.

Each button may be assigned a regular function and a shift function. To use shift functions, a button must be assigned the special shift function. The shift button will then act like a shift key on a keyboard; when held, it modifies the other buttons to execute their assigned shift functions. The available button functions are described below.\nGeneral\n\nnone: Do nothing, button is disabled\nshift: When held, act as a shift modifier for other buttons\narm_toggle: Toggle the armed state of the vehicle\narm: Arm the vehicle\ndisarm: Disarm the vehicle\ngain_toggle: Toggle between minimum and maximum pilot input gain sensitivity\ngain_inc: Increase pilot input gain/sensitivity\ngain_dec: Decrease pilot input gain/sensitivity\ntrim_roll_inc: Trim level target roll to the right\ntrim_roll_dec: Trim level target roll to the left\ntrim_pitch_inc: Trim level target pitch forward\ntrim_pitch_dec: Trim level target pitch backward\ninput_hold_toggle: Toggle holding current joystick axis inputs (cruise control on/off)\nroll_pitch_toggle: Toggle between roll/pitch and forward/lateral control on joystick input\n\nRoll and Pitch Control\nPresently (due to legacy/inheritance reasons), there is no convenient way to control the roll and pitch of and ArduSub vehicle with QGroundControl. The available solution is to use the roll_pitch_toggle joystick button function. When this button is pushed, the forward and lateral joystick axes toggle between controlling the forward and lateral motion of the vehicle and controlling the roll and pitch of the vehicle.\nThe roll and pitch input behaves differently in different flight modes. See the flight mode documentation for more information about how the different flight modes operate.\n\nMANUAL: The roll and pitch input control the rotation rate of the vehicle. As long as the joystick input is deflected, the vehicle will continue to rotate. A centered joystick input commands a rotation rate of zero.\nACRO: This functions like MANUAL, but the rate of rotation is precisely controlled and stabilized.\nSTABILIZE: The roll and pitch input control the rotation rate of the vehicle attitude. When the joystick input is centered, the vehicle will stabilize and hold the current attitude. Press the roll_pitch_toggle joystick button while the vehicle is deflected to lock the current deflection angle and return to controlling forward and lateral motion. To clear the roll and pitch input command, switch to MANUAL mode, or press the mount_center button while roll/pitch control is active.\nDEPTH HOLD: This functions like STABILIZE mode.\n\nMode Selection\nThese button functions will command a switch to the corresponding flight mode.

The failsafe is cleared if the leak detector reports no leaks for two seconds.\nInternal Pressure\nThis is triggered when the internal pressure of the water tight enclosure (WTE) exceeds the threshold set by the FS_PRESS_MAX parameter for two seconds. The failsafe is cleared immediately when the internal pressure is less than the threshold value.\nInternal Temperature\nThis is triggered when the internal temperature of the water tight enclosure (WTE) exceeds the threshold set by the FS_TEMP_MAX parameter. The failsafe is cleared immediately when the internal temperature is less than the threshold value.\nGround Control Station HEARTBEAT\nTriggered when a HEARTBEAT from the ground control station matching SYSID_MYGCS hasn't been received for more than 2.5 seconds. The failsafe is cleared immediately when a HEARTBEAT is received.\nNote If the system id of the companion computer is a match with SYSID_MYGCS , then the heartebeats originating from a process (ie MAVProxy) on the companion computer may prevent this failsafe from triggering when expected.\nPilot Input\nTriggered when pilot manual control input has not been received since the amount of time specified by the FS_PILOT_TIMEOUT parameter.\nSensors\nTriggered when a sensor failure prevents the current flight mode to proceed. This occurs if the depth sensor fails while in depth hold mode. The autopilot will switch into MANUAL mode when triggered. This failsafe is always enabled, and is not configurable.\nBattery\nTriggered when the battery voltage drops below the voltage specified by the FS_BATT_VOLTAGE parameter, or if the remaining capacity drops below the capacity specified by the FS_BATT_MAH parameter.\nEKF\nTriggered when the EKF compass or velocity variances exceed the threshold set by the FS_EKF_THRESH parameter.\nCrash\nTriggered when the angle error exceeds 30 degrees for more than 2 seconds. This is never triggered in Manual or Acro flight modes.\nActions\nDisabled\nThe failsafe is disabled, and nothing (not even event logging) will happen.\nWarn Only\nA message will be sent to the ground control station indicating the failsafe conditions have been met. The warning is sent via STATUSTEXT messages, there is no mechanism to immediately re-send the message in the case that it was not received by the ground control station. The warning is sent repeatedly at 20~30 second intervals as long as the failsafe conditions are met.\nThese warnings are also sent if the failsafe action is set to anything other than Disabled.\nDisarm\nIf the vehicle is armed, the vehicle will disarm immediately when the failsafe conditions are met. The vehicle can be re-armed after the failsafe triggers, even while the failsafe conditions are met, as long as the arming checks are passing. If the failsafe clears due to resolved conditions, the vehicle will disarm again if the failsafe is re-triggered. \nSurface\nIf the vehicle is armed, the vehicle will enter Surface flight mode. The flight mode can be changed by the pilot, and the vehicle may be disarmed at any point.\nHold\nIf the vehicle is armed, the vehicle will enter Position Hold mode, or Depth Hold mode, if positioning is not possible.\n\nSponsored by Blue Robotics.

These telemetry logs contain all of the MAVLink messages received in their binary format. MAVProxy and QGroundControl save telemetry logs locally in a .tlog file. Telemetry logs are the preferred way of diagnosing most problems.\nOnce connected to the autopilot, MAVProxy will save all telemetry to a file called 'mav.tlog'. The mav.tlog file is saved under the same path from which MAVProxy was run. By default, QGroundControl only begins logging telemetry after the vehicle has been armed. QGroundControl can be configured to log telemetry while the autopilot is disarmed in the General tab of the Vehicle Seup menu (click the purple 'Q' icon in the menu bar). Select the option to save logs 'even if vehicle was not armed' in order to log telemetry while disarmed. QGroundControl saves the telemetry logs in the 'Telemetry' directory under the 'Save Path' that is specified in the General tab of the Vehicle Seup menu.\n\nDataFlash logs\nDataFlash logs are saved by the Autopilot directly to on-board memory (SD card in the case of the Pixhawk), regardless of a telemetry connection. These logs are saved in a .bin file. DataFlash logs are capable of logging data at a much faster rate than telemetry logs. The DataFlash logs are named and saved in ascending order. If GPS is available, the logs will be dated according to the GPS timestamp. DataFlash log files can be opened and inspected with MAVProxy, APM Planner 2 or Mission Planner.\nBy default, a new dataflah log file is created when the vehicle is initially armed, and logging is performed only while the vehicle is armed. The LOG_DISARMED parameter can be set to 'Enabled' in order to begin a DataFlash log as soon as the autopilot is booted, even before arming. With LOG_DISARMED enabled, logging will be performed whether the vehicle is armed or disarmed, until the vehicle is powered down.\n\nDownloading\nDataFlash logs can be retrieved in two ways:\n\nRemove the Micro SD card from the Pixhawk and plug it into your computer to view and transfer the logs using a file explorer like a regular USB drive.\n\nDownload the logs remotely via QGroundControl or MAVProxy.\n\nLog downloading via QGroundControl\n  Click the Analyze icon at the top of the window. The icon looks like a magnifying glass over a document.\n  Click the 'Refresh' button to view available logs.\n  Select the log you would like to download, and click 'Download'.\n  Multiple logs can be downloaded by highlighting the desired logs before clicking 'Download'.\n  \n\nLog downloading via MAVProxy\n  While connected to the autopilot via MAVProxy, type 'log list' in the MAVProxy console to list the available DataFlash logs onboard the autopilot.\n  Type 'log download X' to download log number X\n  While the log is downloading, you can type 'log status' to view the status of the download, or 'log cancel' to cancel the download.\n\n\n\n\nLog Analysis\nTelemetry logs and dataflash logs are stored in different formats, and contain different (but in many cases overlapping) data. The log entries for telemetry logs are the MAVLink messages that are documented here and here. The log entries in dataflash logs are self-documented in their binary format, but the formats can also be determined by looking at the code here.\nBelow is a brief description of some tools that are available for viewing and extracting data from logs.\nMAVExplorer.py\nMAVExplorer is a command line/graphical tool used to plot log data. MAVExplorer supports both telemetry logs and dataflash logs, and is included as part of a MAVProxy installation. Please refer to the MAVExplorer documentation for more information. Note, the log file name should not contain any spaces when using this tool\nmavlogdump.py\nmavlogdump.py is a command line tool used to filter and export log data to plain-text files like .csv or .json. mavlogdump.py supports both telemetry logs and dataflash logs, and it is just one of many such log analysis tools included as part of a pymavlink installation (also installed with MAVProxy).

They are stored on internal memory on the autopilot, and are loaded when the autopilot boots up. Most of the configuration in the Vehicle Setup page in QGroundControl takes place by changing parameter values on the autopilot behind the scenes. Some parameters require a reboot to take effect, but most do not.\nSaving and Loading\nThe entire set of parameters on the autopilot can be saved to a text file. Parameters can also be loaded from a text file, overwriting the current parameters on the autopilot. The parameter file reflects all of the settings that the user can adjust in the autopilot. This makes it a very useful tool for troubleshooting, and it is important to save and share a parameter file with the community if you need support with setting up or operating.\nTo save or load parameters using QGroundControl, go to the Vehicle Setup Page, and click the Parameters tab. Click the Tools dropdown menu in the upper right hand corner and select Save to file or Load from file.\nRefreshing\nSome of the parameters are dynamic and will change under certain circumstances or after different events. In order to reload the current parameter values on the autopilot click Refresh.\nResetting\nThe entire set of parameters can be erased and reset to the default values that are configured in the autopilot firmware by clicking Reset all to defaults (ArduSub V3.5+ only).\n\nParameter Files\nThese files have the recommended parameters for ArduSub, making it easy to setup and update parameters on your vehicle.

Hopefully this will help to solves issues for others.\nVehicle Control\nVehicle has telemetry but does not respond to joystick\nMake sure you followed the instructions in Joystick/Gamepad Calibration and that the \"Enable joystick input\" checkbox is checked.\nVehicle flips itself over\nCheck that the motor directions are configured correctly. Also check that the motors are connected to the correct motor outputs on the flight controller, according to the supported frame diagrams.\nVehicle turns or moves even when not controlled to do so.\nPlease check RCx_TRIM parameters to make sure that all trims are set to 1500, with the exception of RC3_TRIM, which should be set to 1100.\nMotors spin as soon as the vehicle is armed.\nMake sure that the vehicle is in Manual mode.\nThe flight controller attempts to stabilize the vehicle's attitude so that it is perfectly level. If the vehicle's attitude is off from level, even a fraction of a degree, the flight controller will spin the motors in an attempt to correct the error. If the vehicle is sitting on land, the error will not change, and the flight controller will spin the motors faster and faster as it tries harder and harder to correct the error. Testing the vehicle on land should be done in MANUAL mode, which just passes pilot inputs to the motors with no stabilization.\nNo Telemetry (No Autopilot Connection)\nVerify Network Configuration\nVerify that your network settings are correct. Verify your network configuration by entering the command ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Mac/Linux) on the surface computer command line. The output should show that your Ethernet IP address is 192.168.2.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.\nYou should be able to ping the companion computer from the surface computer. On the surface computer's command line enter:\nping 192.168.2.2\nIf you do not get a ping response, then something is wrong with the network communication between the surface computer and the companion computer. You may have to adjust your firewall and/or antivirus settings to allow QGrouncControl access to the network.\nFirewall and Antivirus\nAntivirus and firewall software can block the incomming connection from the ROV. Make an exception/rule to allow inbound and outbound traffic on UDP ports 5600 and 14550, or turn off your antivirus and firewall software.\nCabling\nTry replacing your Ethernet cable. Sometimes the wires inside a cable break, and the cable stops working.\nReboot Computer\nIf you are using Windows, sometimes the computer needs to be rebooted for network settings to take affect.\nVerify QGC Autoconnect settings\nMake sure that the QGroundControl is configured to automatically connect to UDP and USB links. Click on the 'Q' icon in the upper left to view the Application Settings. Click on the 'General Settings' tab. In the options for 'Autoconnect to:', make sure the UDP option is checked.\n\nVerify Autopilot USB Connection\nCheck if the Autopilot is connected with following steps:\n\nNavigate to the system page in the Companion web interface\nCheck the list of detected serial devices for an entry that says Pixhawk Autopilot\nIf you do not see an entry that says Pixhawk Autopilot, check the autopilot connection with the Companion computer.\n\nYou can test the autopilot and the usb cable by connecting the autopilot directly to your surface computer and checking the connection with QGroundControl.\nIf you cannot connect to the autopilot:\nTry using a different usb cable. Make sure that the USB cable has data lines, some USB cables only provide power and will not allow communication. You can connect the Pixhawk to the surface computer directly with the USB cable to verify that the USB cable works.\nTry connecting the autopilot to a different usb port\nTry replacing the autopilot\n\n\n\n\nIf you see an entry in the detected serial devices list that says Pixhawk Autopilot (bootloader), you must flash the autopilot with ArduSub firmware. Click the 'Restore Default Firmware' button on the system page, and wait for the text on the bottom of the page to indicate that the process is complete.\n\n\nIf you do not see the system web page, make sure the companion computer is powered on with a supply that is capable of delivering at least 2A. Check the activity lights on the Raspberry Pi Ethernet Jack. The lights should be on or blinking. If the lights are not on, make sure that you are using a network patch cable, not a crossover cable. Look closely at the color of the wires inside connectors on either end of the network cable, the order of the wires should be the same on both ends of the cable. If everything appears ok with the companion computer and the physical network connection, check your network settings (below).\nCheck MAVProxy\nIf your network is configured correctly, but you still have no telemetry, we need to make sure that MAVProxy is running on the companion computer and that the autopilot and MAVProxy are communicating.\nTo verify that MAVProxy is running, visit the system page in the companion web interface, and look for the mavproxy entry under the list of active services.\nTo verify that MAVProxy and the autopilot are communicating, log into the Companion computer via the web terminal, ssh, or PuTTY (user: pi, password: companion), and enter the command:\nscreen -r mavproxy\nIf Mavproxy and the autopilot are working correctly, the output should contain something like this:\nAPM: ArduSub V3.4 (422c10cf)\nAPM: PX4: 96a4c296 NuttX: 580f5354\nAPM: Frame: ROV_VECTORED_FRAME\nAPM: PX4v2 0048003B 3135510C 35333436\nReceived 608 parameters\nSaved 608 parameters to mav.parm\nTo return to the command line and keep the mavproxy process running, hit control+a then type 'd' (to detach).\nIf you still do not have telemetry after all of these steps, please reboot the surface computer and the companion computer, and try again. If it is still not working after rebooting, please leave a comment on discuss.bluerobotics.com with notes on your results of all of the above troubleshooting steps.\nNo Video\nIf you do not have telemetry, please troubleshoot that first according to the above instructions.\nBegin by verifying that your network settings are correct, your Ethernet IP address should be 192.168.2.1 and the subnet mask should be 255.255.255.0.\nIf you have telemetry, but no video, make sure the video settings are correct in QGroundControl. The video settings are found in the General tab of the Application Settings (Q icon) view. The video source should be set to UDP video, and the port should be 5600. These are the default settings. If you change these settings, you will need to close and re-launch QGroundControl.\n\nIf you are using Linux, you must install a few dependencies for the video to work:\napt install gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly\nVerify that your camera is detected by seeing it listed under the detected video devices section on the Companion system webpage. If your camera is not detected, make sure that the camera supports H.264 video output, and make sure the cable is well-seated, or try another camera cable.\nVerify that the video streaming service is active; it should be listed under the active services on the Companion system webpage.\nIf you are using a Windows computer:\n\nDisable/re-enable the network interface\nReboot\nQGC installs three shortcuts: QGC, QGC (GPU Safe Mode), and QGC (GPU Compatibility Mode). Try launching QGC with each of these shortcuts\n\nPoor video streaming performance\nThe video stream should have about 200ms delay, just barely noticeable. There are many factors that could cause lag, low framerate, and pixelation/tearing in the video.\nHere are some tips for troubleshooting poor video performance:\nIn general:\n\nBandwidth - Test the bandwidth at 192.168.2.2:2770/network. The maximum theoretical bandwidth on a Raspberry Pi 3 is 100Mbps, if the bandwidth tests achieve greater than 70Mbps, it is a very good connection. Systems with bandwidths below 40Mbps should be diagnosed for issues.\nTry another cable - Not all cables are created equal; some are really junk.\nUpdate Software - Use the latest software to make sure you are getting the best performance.\nCompanion  computer  power supply - Most companion computers require a power supply capable of providing 5V at 2A. Smaller/weaker power supplies can severely affect performance of the companion computer.\nTether interface power supply - If you are using a tether interface board, make sure it has a solid power supply. Some laptop USB ports cannot provide enough power for the tether interface board to perform optimally. Try using a portable USB battery charger.\nTether interface connections - Make sure that all connections are well-seated and tight.\nSystem resources - Open the system resource monitor and look at how much CPU and RAM your computer is using. Try closing other programs like anti-virus and screen recorders to make more system resources available to programs used to operate the vehicle.\nResolution - Modify the video stream Frame Size at 192.168.2.2:2770/camera. Change it to a value equal to or less than the resolution of your display.\n\nIf you are using a Raspberry Pi camera:\n\nDelete the '--intra 1' setting at 192.168.2.2:2770/camera and restart the camera.\nUpdate the companion computer software at 192.168.2.2:2770/system.\n\nIf you are using a Windows computer:\n\nUpgrade to Windows 10!\nTry these three suggestions by Bo Koppel:\n\nWhen using original power supply that supply laptop (but not charge at the same time) there is something probably in BIOS that slow down graphic card to save energy. That makes processor do some of the graphics calculations. (And actually consume even more energy!)\nSolution: Go on battery or use a large powersupply (in our case 120W)\nHow to quick check if this is the problem: pull out powersupply, if this is the case, latency disappear in two seconds.\n\nNvidia powerful graphic cards use an engine called PhysX for games etc. It seams QGC does not use that.\nAlso QGC works default on motherboard graphic card, not on the more powerful Nvidia extension card.\nSolution: In Nvidias “control panel” select under “Programs” QGC so Nvidia forces QGC to use Nvidia card.\nSome graphic cards also needs tweeking in Nvidia 3D setup (same place as above line)\n\nReal crazy in a few computers: Switch system fonts from 125% size to 100%\n(Right click desktop, “adjust screen” then “monitor” translated from Swedish OS)\nCheck the 100% tickbox instead of 125%\nLog out and log in again, fixed….\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nCamera does not tilt\nThe output servo rail on the Pixhawk requires a separate 5V power supply. The power module and USB power inputs on the Pixhawk will not power the servo rail. Make sure you have a 5V input on the servo rail via an ESC BEC or standalone BEC.\nCheck that input/output channels are configured for camera tilt.\nCheck that joystick buttons have been assigned to camera tilt functions.\n\"No io thread heartbeat\" message constantly appears.\nThis message indicates that the APM io thread has stopped running. The most likely cause is a corrupted filesystem on the micro SD card. Remove the card from the pixhawk, and format it as FAT32. If the error persists, you will need to replace the SD card, or disable dataflash log files by setting the LOG_BACKEND_TYPE parameter to None (0).\nCompass heading drifts while the vehicle is stationary\nThe compass inside of the ROV is very sensitive and will be affected by large iron/steel structures, including rebar in concrete. You will get the best compass calibration outside, away from large structures and concrete. It is possible to calibrate inside, you may need to increase the value of the COMPASS_OFS_MAX parameter before you get a passing calibration. Note that the compass will always be affected by ferrous structures because they distort Earth's magnetic field, however the heading should remain stationary (maybe incorrect) while the vehicle is stationary in any case.\nPerform these steps to recalibrate the compass:\n\nPower on the vehicle and wait 10 minutes to ensure the sensors are warmed up.\nMake sure that the INS_GYR_CAL parameter value is set to 'Never'.\nPerform an accelerometer calibration.\nPerform a compass calibration.\nReboot the vehicle. The compass should be still.\n\nIssue Reporting\nWe're always trying to make our documentation, instructions, software, and user experience better.

RC Input is an array of control channels representing pilot inputs like forward and yaw commands. RC Output is an array of channels representing the pulse widths to write to individual servo output pins. Although ArduSub does not support the use of RC receivers, the logic is the same and is applied to joystick inputs instead. Joystick input and RC Input are synonymous in ArduSub.\nRC Inputs\nThese are the default channel mappings for RC input:\n\n\n\nChannel\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n1\nPitch\n\n\n2\nRoll\n\n\n3\nThrottle\n\n\n4\nYaw\n\n\n5\nForward\n\n\n6\nLateral\n\n\n7\nCamera Pan\n\n\n8\nCamera Tilt\n\n\n9\nLights 1 Level\n\n\n10\nLights 2 Level\n\n\n11\nVideo Switch\n\n\n\nRC Outputs\nOn the Pixhawk, there are 8 main outputs and 6 auxiliary outputs. The main outputs are updated at 200Hz by default (configured via the RC_SPEED parameter), and the auxiliary outputs are always updated at 50Hz. It is important not to connect analog servos to the main outputs, because the very fast update rate can cause the servo to burn itself out.\nBy default, aux outputs 5 and 6 (SERVO13 and SERVO14) are reserved as GPIO pins to be used for relays, and will not output a pwm signal for other functions. This is configured with the BRD_PWM_COUNT parameter, which determines how many of the auxiliary outputs to configure as PWM outputs (default is 4).\n"},"operators-manual/outputs.html":{"url":"operators-manual/outputs.html","title":"Controlling Outputs","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Outputs\nThe Pixhawk has 14 servo output channels which are configured via the SERVOn_* parameters and the BRD_PWM_COUNT parameter.\n\n\n\nPixhawk Label\nServo Channel\n\n\n\n\nMain 1\n1\n\n\nMain 2\n2\n\n\nMain 3\n3\n\n\nMain 4\n4\n\n\nMain 5\n5\n\n\nMain 6\n6\n\n\nMain 7\n7\n\n\nMain 8\n8\n\n\nAux 1\n9\n\n\nAux 2\n10\n\n\nAux 3\n11\n\n\nAux 4\n12\n\n\nAux 5\n13\n\n\nAux 6\n14\n\n\n\nThe Pixhawk has 6 'auxiliary' outputs that can be configured as either general purpose input/output or PWM output.\nThe auxiliary pins are configured at boot according to the BRD_PWM_COUNT parameter.\n\n\n\nBRD_PWM_COUNT   Aux pin configuration \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n0\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\n\n\n2\nPWM\nPWM\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\n\n\n(default) 4\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nGPIO\nGPIO\n\n\n6\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\n\n\n\nControlling Servos\nAn output must be configured as PWM via the BRD_PWM_COUNT parameter to operate a servo.\nThe servos can be operated via the mavlink command DO_SET_SERVO.

This command can conflict with other functions operating on the servo channel like pan/tilt mounts or lights. In order to avoid conflicts, the corresponding SERVOn_FUNCTION parameter should be set to Disabled (0).\nUp to three servos can also be operated via joystick button functions.

When a Companion computer is connected to a ground computer, a user can access the web-interface on 192.168.2.2:2770. Users can access Network, System, Camera and Routing pages alongside a number of other user friendly options as described below.\nCompanion Header\nThe web interface header displays the Companion software version. It provides navigation links to the main configuration pages available in the web interface, options to restart and shutdown the Companion computer, and a switch to enable advanced options on the current page (if available).\n\nNetwork\nThe web interface by default opens at the Network page. This page allows users to:\n\nConfigure WiFi\nCheck WiFi and Internet Status \nConfigure Ethernet IP address\nTest the network for Uploads and Downloads\nEthernet network configuration (advanced): The Ethernet interface can be configured as DHCP Server, DHCP Client or Manual (static) mode.\nManual: Manual: The interface is configured with a static IP address. This is the default configuration. The default IP address is 192.168.2.2.\nDHCP Server: The interface is configured as a DHCP server on the 192.168.2.x subnet. The interface IP address will be 192.168.2.2 in this mode.\nDHCP Client: This is useful for connecting to a router.\n\n\n\n\nSystem\nThe System page provides the following functionalities and features:\n\nUpdate the Companion software\nDisplay system resource information\nDisplay the active services\nDisplay detected/recognized devices\n\n\n\nDisplay current ArduSub firmware version on the autopilot\nDownload, Update, or Restore pixhawk firmware\nDownload a system log for the web interface\n\n\nCamera\nThe Camera page allows the user to view and make changes to:\n\nDetailed camera settings including Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Sharpness, etc. among others\nVideo Streaming settings including selecting a video device, format and frame size\n\n\nRouting\nThe Routing page can be used to route serial communications between serial devices and network ports. It can be used to create one-to-one, and one-to-many connections. The configuration on this page is persistent and loaded at boot. The configuration is stored in the file ~/routing.conf.\n\nNote This program is written in python and is not optimized or well-suited for high-bandwidth applications. The maximum recommended baudrate is 115200. If high bandwidth routing is required, standard linux tools like tty, socat and netcat should be used instead.\n\n\nTo use the companion routing tool:\n\ncreate one or more endpoints with your desired configuration\nadd connections between the endpoints as you want\nremove connections by clicking the 'broken link' button next to the configuration\nremove endpoints by clicking the 'trash can' button next to the configuration\n\n\nEndpoints\nAn endpoint can be a serial port or a network port. Create an endpoint by entering the desired port settings, and click 'create link'.\nSerial Endpoints\nSelect one of the available serial ports from the drop down list, and choose the baudrate to use. The serial port must not be in use by another program! Click 'Add Serial Endpoint' to create the communication endpoint.\n\nUDP Endpoints\nEnter the ip address and UDP port to use. If the ip address is '0.0.0.0', it will bind the local port as a server. All other ip addresses will result in a client connection. Click 'Add UDP Endpoint' to create the communication endpoint.\n\nRoutes\nEndpoints can be connected bidirectionally (typical), or with a one way connection. To begin routing communications between endpoints, choose the endpoints that you wish to connect, the direction to route communications, and click 'connect'.\n\nExample configurations\nTopside as UDP Server\nTo bridge serial communications between a device connected to the companion computer inside the ROV, and the existing network connection to the topside computer:\n\nCreate a serial endpoint corresponding to the attached serial device and the desired serial baudrate\nCreate a UDP endpoint using the topside computer IP address 192.168.2.1, and the port that the topside application will bind.\nConnect them bidirectionally\nThe application on the topside computer should bind the UDP port as a server\n\nTo test the connection on a linux machine, bind to the port with \"netcat\" on the topside computer: nc -ulp \n\nNote Topside as UDP Server mode is not recommended for master-slave setups. For the connection to be properly stabilished, the serial device must send some data. Only then the connection is stabilished and the topside is able to send data to the companion.\n\nThis python script exemplifies how to run an UDP server with Python:\n\"\"\"\nCompanion routing UDP server example.\n\nThis script Binds to an UDP port and receives data from the Companion at\na given port.\nYou should run this at your topside computer.\n\"\"\"\nimport socket\n\nUDP_IP = \"192.168.2.1\" # Topside (local) IP\nUDP_PORT = 5555        # Topside (local) port to listen on\n\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, # Internet\n                    socket.SOCK_DGRAM) # UDP\nsock.bind((UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))\n\nwhile True:\n    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024) # Buffer size is 1024 bytes\n    print(data.decode())\n\nCompanion as UDP Server\n\nCreate a serial endpoint corresponding to the attached serial device and the desired serial baudrate\nCreate a UDP endpoint using the 0.0.0.0 IP address, and the port that the server will bind to.\nConnect them bidirectionally\nThe application on the topside computer should connect to 192.168.2.2 at the port chosen in step two\n\nTo test the connection on a linux machine, bind to the port with \"netcat\" on the topside computer: nc -u 192.168.2.2 \nThis Python example shows how to communicate using these UDP ports:\n\"\"\"\nCompanion routing UDP client example.\n\nThis script connects to a endpoint at the Companion exposed using the IP 0.0.0.0\nand a given port. It then sends some data so the server knows it has a client\nand starts relaying the serial data back at it.\nYou should run this at your topside computer.\n\"\"\"\nimport socket\nimport time\n\nUDP_IP = \"192.168.2.2\" # Remote (Companion's) IP to connect to\nUDP_PORT = 5555        # Remote (Companion's) port to connect to\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n\ntry:\n    # Send something so the server knows where to reply to\n    sent = sock.sendto(b\"hello\", (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))\n    # Loop receiving data\n    while True:\n        data, server = sock.recvfrom(4096)\n        print(data.decode())\n        time.sleep(0.01)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)\nfinally:\n    sock.close()\n\n\nOther Pages:\nApart from the four pages that can be accessed via direct links, Companion web interface also provides a few other pages for interacting with some more features.\nMAVProxy\nMAVProxy page allows the user to:\n\nAdjust the MAVProxy settings\nRestart or Restore MAVProxy\n\n\nGit\nGit page is used for:\n\nDisplaying the current head\nAdding remote repositories\nUpdating the system to development branches\n\n\nManual updates\n\nThis feature is for development and testing only. It can result in unstable behavior or an unusable system. You should only use this if directed during technical support or beta testing.\n\nBefore continuing, make sure that you have internet access.\nSteps to manually update via the Git page:\n\nClick in Fetch to get the last changes of the remote repositories.\nSelect the desired remote, origin for Blue Robotics repository.\nClick in tags to open the available options.\nSelect the tag that you want to update, it'll be highlighted when selected.\nClick in Update to update companion to the selected version.\n\n\nWaterlinked\nWaterlinked page can be used to: \n\nSetup waterlinked underwater GPS driver\nRestart driver\n\n\nTerminal over browser\nTerminal page can be used to:\n\nInteract with the Companion from a web browser using terminal. (Useful for those who do not use Ubuntu/Linux)\n\n\nFile System Access\nFile Manager page can be used to:\n\nView, Download, delete, move, rename, or archive the files on the Companion computer directly from the web browser\n\n\nMAVLink REST API\nStarting from companion 0.0.19, a MAVLink REST API (http://192.168.2.2:4777/mavlink) endpoint is available.\nIt provides access to the last MAVLink messages sent by the vehicle in json format.\nThe json contains the same structure defined by the MAVLink protocol standard,\nwhere each field exists and can be accessible.\nBesides the MAVLink

With pymavlink, it is possible to create a python script to read sensor data and send commands to an ArduSub vehicle.\nPlease reference the pymavlink repository and chat for further information.\nSafety\nThe autopilot employs a some failsafe mechanisms to keep you and your equipement safe, as well as to prevent your ROV from running away from you during experiments.\nAll system components that communicate via MAVLink are expected to send a HEARTBEAT message at a constant rate of at least 1 Hz. If the autopilot does not receive a heartbeat from your application after this interval, it will trigger a failsafe.\nWhen the autopilot is being commanded to move via RC_CHANNELS_RAW or MANUAL_CONTROL messages, the messages must be sent at a constant rate like the HEARTBEAT message.

Please see the documentation for your respective autopilot.\nMaking a Custom Configuration\nOne of the biggest additions to the ArduSub code is a six degree-of-freedom motor library that allows a wide variety of motor configurations to be set up easily. The motors libraries for each configuration are built on a set of higher-level motor classes as follows:\nAP_Motors\n    |---- AP_MotorsMulticopter\n                   |---- AP_MotorsMatrix\n                                |---- AP_Motors6DOF\nTo add a new motor configuration, you will need to add your custom motor setup to AP_Motors6DOF.cpp. Find the following line, and add your frame configuration there. The frame is configured at boot according to the FRAME_CONFIG parameter. You will need to change this parameter to CUSTOM to use your custom frame.\ncase AS_MOTORS_CUSTOM_FRAME:\n    // Put your custom motor setup here\nThe behavior of each motor will be defined by its assigned contributions to each of the 6 degrees of freedom in AP_Motors6DOF.cpp. You can use the other frame configurations as a reference guide to defining your own custom configuration. Here is the BlueROV1 frame configuration as an example:\n\n\n\nMotor #\nRoll Factor\nPitch Factor\nYaw Factor\nThrottle Factor\nForward Factor\nLateral Factor\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n-1.0\n0\n1.0\n0\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n1.0\n0\n1.0\n0\n\n\n3\n-0.5\n0.5\n0\n0.45\n0\n0\n\n\n4\n0.5\n0.5\n0\n0.45\n0\n0\n\n\n5\n0\n-1.0\n0\n1.0\n0\n0\n\n\n6\n-0.25\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\nUsing the New Custom Configuration\nTo use the newly created frame, set the FRAME_CONFIG parameter to \"Custom\" in QGroundControl and then reboot the flight controller.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf something goes wrong while compiling:\nCheck the compiling section to set up your environment.\nArduSub is only compatible with GCC 6. Be sure that \"gcc-arm-none-eabi 6\" is your \"PATH\" env with: echo $PATH | grep gcc-arm-none-eabi.\nIt's also possible to add custom paths for the compiler with export PATH=/your_path/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q2-update/bin/:$PATH. Run ./waf configure --board Pixhawk1 again if compiling with WAF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored by Blue Robotics. Code released under the GPLv3 License.

All GPS/positioning functionality in ArduSub is IN DEVELOPMENT. The position-enabled flight modes are not considered stable. However, a positioning system may be integrated in order to display the position of the vehicle on the Ground Control Station map. This can be done without making use of the position-enabled flight modes, and this sort of operation is considered stable.\nForwarding NMEA data to companion\n The first step to using ArduSub with a positioning system is to get the positioning system data into the autopilot. The Companion computer in the ROV listens for NMEA data on udp port 27000. You can forward NMEA data to this port, and the ROV will automatically use that for it's gps position. The NMEA data can come from a USBL or other positioning system, or from an application that is synthesizing a GPS position using computer vision, motion capture, or other means. A useful application for bridging NMEA data between a COM port on the surface computer and the udp port on the ROV is the NMEA Router by Neal Arundale.\nThe positioning system must report the number of satellites, and the satellites must be greater than 6 for the autopilot to accept the position as a valid lock. When a valid position and lock is detected by the autopilot, the main LED on the autopilot will change from blue to green.\nOn a pi terminal, enter the command screen -r nmearx to see if the data is correctly making it's way into the ROV system. Enter ctrl+A, then d to 'detach' from the screen and return to the pi terminal.\nAutopilot configuration\nThere is some configuration that needs to be done on the autopilot in order for the absolute positioning to perform correctly. These parameters need to be set:\n\nGPS_TYPE = MAV(14) (This is done automatically by the same application that listens for data on port 27000)\nEK2_GPS_TYPE = 2D Position(2) (We don't want to use the 3D position, we get very good depth measurements from the pressure sensor)\n\nThe Autopilot and the positioning system need to agree on where North is. Turn the vehicle until the autopilot indicates that it is facing north, and check that the positioning system reports the same heading. If the positioning system does not provide a heading estimate for the vehicle, move the vehicle forward towards North, and make sure that the positioning system reflects this accurately.\nIf the two systems do not agree on North:\n\nCalibrate the compass on the autopilot\nVerify the magnetic heading of the autopilot, change the COMPASS_DEC parameter if neccessary\nOffset the positioning system heading to match the autopilot heading. If this is not possible offset the autopilot heading with the COMPASS_DEC parameter to match the positioning system heading\n\nThe autopilot navigation filter needs to be tuned to the characteristics of the positioning system. Many factors can affect the tuning requirements including: Accuracy/precision of the positioning system, position update frequency, position update delay behind inertial measurements, etc. The navigation filter parameters can be found here.\nIf the position-enabled flight modes are to be used, the autopilot position controller needs to be tuned. In QGC, check the 'Show advanced settings' option in the General tab of the Application Setup menu, and restart the application. There will be a Tuning tab on the Vehicle Setup page that can be used to facilitate tuning the position controller. The parameters of interest are those with 'XY' in the name in the 'Position Controller' section.\nSending GPS position to ROV\nIt's possible to send position information to the ROV via socket or MAVLink message.\nThis is an alternative for using a system that does not provide NMEA output. I.e: SLAM, visual odometry and etc.\nSocket via MAVProxy\nThe GPSInput module (command module load GPSInput inside MAVProxy command line) of MAVProxy can be used to send position information to the ROV, this module uses socket communication to allow a simple interface layer. The default port is 25100 but can be changed with the parameterGPSInput.port (command set GPSInput.port port_number). The GPS_TYPE parameter of the vehicle need to be MAV to allow the communication.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport time\nimport socket\nimport json\n\nfrom os import system\n\nsockit = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nsockit.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\nsockit.setblocking(0)\n\nwhile True:\n    result = {}\n    result['time_usec'] = 0             #Timestamp (micros since boot or Unix epoch)\n    result['gps_id'] = 0                #ID of the GPS for multiple GPS inputs\n    result['ignore_flags'] = 8|16|32    #Flags indicating which fields to ignore (see GPS_INPUT_IGNORE_FLAGS enum).
